Desktop GUI for [tiddl-elvigilante](https://github.com/np3ir/tiddl-elvigilante), the production-ready TIDAL music downloader. Paste a link, pick the quality, and go — with all the power of the CLI underneath.

**Windows installer with everything bundled**: no Python, no pip, no ffmpeg to install. Download, log in with your TIDAL account, done.

## Features

- **Paste any TIDAL link** — track, album, playlist, artist or mix; hundreds at a time (long lists are split into runs automatically)
- **Smart playlist handling** — download as playlist, or expand into **full albums**, **artist discographies** or **standalone tracks** (each with its proper folder layout and templates)
- **Artist safety dialog** — confirms before massive discography downloads and lets you pick singles/videos per run
- **Live progress** — real progress bar with counter, currently-downloading track with percentage, timestamped log
- **Full settings, QBDLX-style** — download/scan/video folders, a separate **playlist folder** (another disk if you want), naming templates, threads and anti-bot delays, lyrics (embed in tags and/or `.lrc` sidecar files)
- **Built-in TIDAL login** — device-code flow straight from the app
- **English / Español**, violet dark & light themes, adjustable font size
- **Single-download lock** — multiple windows can't hammer the API at once

## Install (Windows)

1. Download `tiddl-ElVigilante-Setup-x.x.x.exe` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. SmartScreen will warn (unsigned installer): **More info → Run anyway**
3. Run the app → **Log in to TIDAL** → set your folders in Settings → download

Requires an active TIDAL subscription (HiFi for lossless quality).

## Install (Linux)

1. Download `tiddl-ElVigilante-x.x.x-linux-x64.tar.gz` from [Releases](../../releases) and extract it
2. Install ffmpeg from your distro (`sudo apt install ffmpeg` or equivalent)
3. Run `./tiddl-gui` → log in to TIDAL → set your folders → download

## Install (macOS)

1. Download `tiddl-ElVigilante-x.x.x-macos.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases) (Apple Silicon), open it and drag the app to Applications
2. The app is unsigned, so macOS quarantines it. If you see **"tiddl-gui is damaged and can't be opened"**, that's the quarantine flag — remove it once from Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr "/Applications/tiddl-gui.app"
   ```
3. Now open the app → log in to TIDAL → set your folders → download

To build the DMG yourself, see [BUILD_MACOS.md](BUILD_MACOS.md).

## Build from source

The GUI is a single-file [Flet](https://flet.dev) app (`main.py`) that drives the `tiddl` CLI as a subprocess — every core feature (skip database, metadata enrichment, retries, rate limiting) lives in [the CLI](https://github.com/np3ir/tiddl-elvigilante) and works unchanged.

Dev run: install the CLI, `pip install flet tomlkit`, then `python main.py`.

Full release (`release.ps1`): builds the GUI with `flet build windows`, the standalone `tiddl.exe` with PyInstaller, and the installer with Inno Setup. Read the comments in the script — several hard-won gotchas are documented there (Flutter refuses paths with special characters, PyInstaller needs rich's dynamic Unicode submodules, flet packages everything in the project folder).
